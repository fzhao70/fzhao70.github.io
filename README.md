## Summary

I’m a Ph.D. candidate in Atmospheric Chemistry & Meteorology at Georgia Tech with an M.S. in Computational Science & Engineering. I design and implement high-performance numerical models in Python and C++ to simulate complex environmental processes. I architect scalable HPC and cloud-based workflows in Linux environments, leveraging parallel computing frameworks for large observational and model datasets. I build machine-learning–driven data pipelines with tools like PySpark and Dask, applying statistical and causal-inference methods to extract actionable insights. I also develop interactive analytics solutions and dashboards that empower stakeholders to monitor key metrics and make data-driven decisions in industrial settings.


## Research Projects

1. Anthropogenic Emissions Drive Elevated Springtime Surface Ozone Levels in China

2. Meteorological Control on Ozone Response to NOx Emission Reduction Events

3. Localized pollutant emission increases in China due to COVID-19 lockdown

4. Chemically induced decline in wintertime SO₂ emission control efficacy

5. Machine Learning Acceleration of Atmospheric Chemistry Mechanism Calculations

## Course Porjects

1. Machine Learning on PM2.5 pattern variation

Applied unsupervised (K-means) and supervised (XGBoost, Random Forest) machine learning methods to
identify regional and seasonal PM2.5 pollution patterns across 317 Chinese cities, revealing dominant
meteorological and chemical factors influencing air quality from 2015–2023.

2. Building Structure’s Response to Earthquakes

Developed and validated deep learning models (LSTM, TCN, Transformer, RNN) to rapidly predict building
displacement during earthquakes, significantly outperforming traditional finite-element methods and enabling
real-time structural response assessment.
