## Summary

I’m a Ph.D. candidate in Atmospheric Chemistry & Meteorology at Georgia Tech with an M.S. in Computational Science & Engineering. I design and implement high-performance numerical models in Python and C++ to simulate complex environmental processes. I architect scalable HPC and cloud-based workflows in Linux environments, leveraging parallel computing frameworks for large observational and model datasets. I build machine-learning–driven data pipelines with tools like PySpark and Dask, applying statistical and causal-inference methods to extract actionable insights. I also develop interactive analytics solutions and dashboards that empower stakeholders to monitor key metrics and make data-driven decisions in industrial settings.
